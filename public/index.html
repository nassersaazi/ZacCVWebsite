                        <p>
                            Hi there! My name is Zac Braddy and I am a Lead Web Developer with just over 5 years 
                            experience and I'm super jazzed by great tech and awesome architect. You might be wondering 
                            how much I like doing the things I do with computers, well to put it simply; I'm super 
                            obsessed by tech. Put this way, sometimes I feel like I might be a mutant code monkey sent 
                            back from the future. Add to that the fact that I can actually talk to people and take pride 
                            in my ability to lead people and there's your explanation.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            My obsession with tech and development has given me the opportunity to experience a lot
                            in a short amount of time. At my core I'm a Fullstack javascript developer, but unlike most
                            full stack developers I had a keen interest in the front end for a good amount of time.
                            This means that I have extensive experience in front end languages frameworks and 
                            technologies. Shall we make a list? HTML + HTML5, CSS + CSS3, SASS, JSON, XML, Javascript 
                            (ES5 and 6), JQuery, Angular 1, ReactJs, Redux, Create react app, Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, 
                            Node + NPM, Bower and other similar technologies to those on the list, but let's not stop 
                            there. On top of all that in the past I've run a blog and Youtube channel based on React and 
                            related technologies which gaves me a much deeper insight into that particular framework. 
                            This lead to me publishing my own React based online course with Manning publications. These 
                            days that experience is put to good use in the blogs and videos I do here and there about 
                            topics I'm interested in.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            But right now I'm working at Koodoo where I get to play with all the buzzwords that developers
                            wish they had the opportunity to work with. I'm building Node microservices which surface a
                            RESTful APIs and communicate internally using NATS. All these services are built into 
                            Docker containers so they can be deployed on to our Kubernetes cluster. We also follow all
                            the best buzzwords in terms of development practices like Agile, Kanban, CI/CD etc. Apart
                            from all the usual QA trappings we also performance test our services using Locust.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            This was not my first time attempting Microservices so I have experience not just with the
                            good but also the bad and ugly. None the less the attempts I've had in the past have seen
                            me get experience with CQRS systems as well as Nancy routing hosted inside of an NServiceBus 
                            wrapper which was then used for messaging. Eventstore for storage; and for CI/CD I had a 
                            combination of Jenkins and Chef. It was certainly an exciting time to be a developer!
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            My career has seen me in roles that not only saw me managing 5 developers but also making 
                            big decisions around the direction of the tooling and architecture for the solution. In most
                            cases I would be able to share here much about the business functionality but I can tell you 
                            that I've worked to architect front ends and back ends alike. Most of my front end experience
                            is React and Redux SPAs I've built these in the past to do things like talk to C#/.NET back 
                            end via SignalR where the code is written using CQRS and DDD methodologies and stores
                            it's data in an Event sourced database. Naturally, in this day and age, all the applications
                            I've been working on recently have been cloud hosted on services like Azure or GCP.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I've been having all this fun over the past couple of years and yet you'll still find me 
                            searching for more. I'm always looking for my next challenge and searching for the next guy 
                            or gal who knows a little bit more than me. When I find them I plan to listen as much as 
                            possible and soak up their super powers! If you're reading this and you like what you've 
                            read so far then maybe we should have a conversation.

                            my Web Development fundamentals which I believe to be important so as not to let them slip.

                            An interesting and free certification given away by MongoDB. It was a 7 week online course with
                            homework and projects. It definitely gave me an edge given that this was around the time that Mongo
                            was starting to solidify it's hold on the No-SQL market and MEAN stack was being discovered to
                            be the excellent stack that it is or was.

                            with gusto. Unfortunately I've always had a different account so my transcript looks a bit sparse.
                            But where I've had the full account I've always attempted the certifications at the end.

                            In these degrees I majored in Accountancy and Software Engineering respectively.
                            I completed a double degree because at the time I was unsure if I wanted to go into business or computing
                            so I did both to cover my bases. I chose the computing route obviously but my Accountancy degree
                            has certainly helped me in the world of Enterprise Software Development.

                    <p>
                        I originally joined Koodoo when it was called Dynamo. I  was place in a position in the team as a
                        Lead and was given the supreme vote of confidence in my abilities from the team by allowing me to
                        step into Lead despite this being my first role as a Full stack Javascript developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As it turned out this vote of confidence was repaid as I was able to play a pivot part in team. To
                        do this was given my first taste of truly stepping into the role as an Architect. It was my 
                        responsibility to ensure that the team was given direction to ensure that we were building a 
                        system that would be massively scalable, extendable, maintainable, etc. To this we built a 
                        microservices system in Node which communicated with each other using NATS and exposed a RESTful
                        API. Each service was built into its own Docker container which was then deployed to a pod in our
                        Kubernetes cluster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with all the tech buzzwords also came the latest and greatest of development processes. We
                        kept agile sprints but used Kanban to organise our work. We followed CI/CD processes which saw us
                        able to deploy sevices in less than 10 minutes and we did this multiple times a day. We were able

                    <p>
                        RightIndem was looking for a full stack developer with React experience and so they were
                        interested in bringing me on board given my experience and the work I had done on my blog at
                        the time "The Reactionary". I was brought on as a Senior Developer and before completing my
                        probation RightIndem saw fit to promote me to Principal Developer in charge of a Team of 5
                        developers who were heading up a project whose aim was to greenfield an application using
                        leading edge technology and it needed to be extensible, maintainable, robust and delivered on
                        time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can't talk about the specifics of the business functionality of the project but I can tell
                        you that what the team and I built was an application which began with a React and Redux front
                        end which spoke via SignalR to a CQRS based c#/.NET Backend which stored it's data in an Event
                        sourced database. In this way our plans were to build a system which could be delivered on time
                        but also was built in such a way that was conducive to moving towards Microservices. Naturally,
                        in this day and age, all the pieces of this application was hosted in the cloud on Azure so I
                        also got experience working with that technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of making decisions around the architecture of the system and ensuring the project was
                        delivered on time my role also included a number of aspects of management including hiring new
                        staff,  mentoring and developing current staff and trying to keep team morale and productivity
                        high.

                    <p>
                        E-Days was my first appointment as a Senior Developer and expectations of me were set high
                        early on. I was told that my front end skills would come in handy as well as my experience with
                        modern development paradigms. E-days was a massive legacy application written in C# using the
                        .NET framework and ASP.NET Webforms. As I'd had experience in both working with web forms and
                        bringing legacy applications into the modern day I was of particular interest to E-Days.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        During my time at E-Days I spent a lot of time learning more deeply the technologies that I'd
                        already worked with in order to ensure that I could not just "do", but also "teach" these patterns and practices.
                        I wrote PoCs and recommendation documents on overhauling the front end of the application using React
                        and Redux and also suggested that we might start a slow process of migrating the application to Microservices.
                        Both of these involved a vast amount of study and effort largely done in my own time for the love
                        of learning.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        All of this was on top of my regular duties as a Senior Developer which involved giving expert advice
                        on how to execute Agile practices as well suggestions on how day to day feature additions should
                        be implemented and also training Junior staff.

                    <p>
                        Although I was hired as a fullstack web developer my duties upon joining and for just under a
                        year were focused heavily in front end development and I invest heavily in the advancement of my
                        front end skills during my personal development time as well. During this year I headed up a
                        critical project to build the foundation for which the development team could overhaul the
                        current client side binding in Trace One's flagship project PDM. PDM was using KnockoutJs at the time.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        This was with the view to not only bring the user experience of the software into the modern day
                        and allow cross browser compatibility but also to bring the development processes and tools used
                        into something that resembles, as closely as possible, a modern front end development environment.
                        I built a sophisticated gulp build pipeline which in turn allowed me to leverage some of the
                        better and newer front end technologies like browserify to help organise our javascript and make
                        it more testable. Also we were able to leverage SASS to allowing us to make sense of the thousands
                        of lines of css that was cascading all over itself.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Once I setup the environment and framework to allow other developers to begin executing the
                        migration of the codebase to something cross browser ready I was moved on to another project
                        which was to be the Pheonix Project of Trace One, if you will. This new software used an
                        AngularJS front end which used events to achieve a loosely coupled architecture of small modules.
                        It used SASS and a gulp pipeline inspired by the one I had built in my previous project. For the
                        back end we use NancyFX for routing, NServiceBus for messaging and Event Store for client data
                        persistence, Ninject for Dependency injection and RavenDB for configuration persistence. We also
                        use Chef and Jenkins for Continuous Integeration and Deployment. Finally, we worked closely with
                        a DevOps team to ensure that Integration and Deployment of the software occurred as smoothly as possible
                        Each of these technologies and practices opened up a world of knowledge for me to consume and I relished
                        the opportunity.

                        Focalpoint. This involved both new Development work as well as bug fixing and code re-factoring
                        work. Focalpoint is a .NET 4.0 Web Forms application which interacts with an SQL database for
                        data persistence so my role saw me writing in languages such as VB.NET, C#, Javascript, HTML,
                        CSS, JQuery and SQL on a daily basis.

                    <p>
                        Focalpoint also has a number of sister applications that act as bolt-ons or standalone
                        applications in their own right. These other applications include a bolt-on to Access's SAAS
                        based offering which is built in ASP.NET MVC4 using Telerik's Kendo MVVM as a front end
                        framework. I worked with this as well as the mobile offering of Focalpoint which is also an
                        ASP.NET MVC4 project with a Kendo front end. Further to this I was regularly exposed to and
                        build tools that use technologies such as WCF and other web related technologies. Access
                        develop using Agile Development methods so I became accustom to this form of Development.

                                    definitely someone you want on your team. He’s a quick study and a fountain of knowledge.

                                    He knows exactly how to get his thoughts and expertise across in a way that fits his audience perfectly.
                                    Reading through his blog or watching his tutorial videos you get a sense for the serious and the humorous side to Zac.

                    I think that mainly, I'm most enthusiastic about tech and furthering my knowledge. I'm well aware that
                    if I am to amass the sort of knowledge that I wish to in my life time I need to be diligent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That said, I'm not a robot and in my down time I like to play video games, Apex Legend is my poison 
                    of choice at the moment. I also like to escape a little to Virtual Reality with my HTC Vive.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    TV series keep me entertained if I ever find a moment to myself. At the moment I'm deep into Game of 
                    Thrones and The Walking Dead.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I also really enjoy playing board games and tabletop RPGs whenever I get the chance to. The final 
                    item on my list of geeky things that I enjoy is the fact that I'm an avid comic book fan. You can 
                    make mine Marvel and my three favourite heros are Deadpool, Dr Strange and Moon Knight. The last 
                    couple of years have been good for me in that my favourite characters have been getting movies and 
                    if a Moon Knight movie comes out soon I may just bust!
